# MyCannyEdgeDetector

In the python file, I have defined a function myCannyEdgeDetector(image, Low_Threshold, High_Threshold).  I have not used the inbuilt canny edge detection function of skimage inside the myCannyEdgeDetector(image, Low_Threshold, High_Threshold) function.  In the word document, I have discussed how I decided the Low and high thresholds for hysteresis.  What were your observations? 
On running MyCannyEdgeDetectorDemo.py, it generates the following items for an input image â€“ 
(i) output of skimage.feature.canny for the input image
(ii) edge output of myCannyEdgeDetector()
(iii) Computed and displayed the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Metric (SSIM) between the outputs of skimage's canny edge detector and the myCannyEdgeDetector().
