Task: Write your own Canny edge detector 

How did you decide the Low and high thresholds for hysteresis? 

Playing around with the constant global low and high thresholds , I realized we needed some logic to back up my choice of thresholds as global threshold choice gave good results with some but were not good with others. 
Therefore, in the thresholding step of my code I slowly started increasing the value of my low threshold value from 0 and decreasing my high threshold value from 255 to an appropriate tradeoff based on the SSIM ratio . If the value of the ratio was greater than the present then i update the values of the threshold. 

What were your observations?
We observed the following indices which quantize the similarity between our myCannyEdgeDetector()and the standard canny(inputImage,3)functions:)
Changing the thresholds led to variation in the degree of edges that were considered in my filter, as I increased the value of the low threshold the fine edges diminished whereas the PSNR value increased as we increased the high threshold.
